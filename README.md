# BlindTop75

The purpose of this repo is to document the solutions of https://www.teamblind.com/post/New-Year-Gift---Curated-List-of-Top-75-LeetCode-Questions-to-Save-Your-Time-OaM1orEU

The solution will be added on the same day that I have worked on the problem.  Note: I may have come to a solution on my own or looked up the solution myself.  If I did not come up with the solution, I have made a note to review this problem.

I will aim to solve a total of 2 problems per day (Morning and Night).

Edit: Need to be more consistent with solving at least 2 per day. 4/20/21

Edit: Edited comments for clarity. 4/22/21
